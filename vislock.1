.SH DESCRIPTION
.hw vis-lock
.B vislock
is a Linux screen locker which will lock all local virtual
console and X11 screens while active.
.B vislock
detects the set of local users who should be able to unlock the
screen; that list can be augmented from the command line.  Depending
on options, the screen can display those user names, the time, and the
remaining battery capacity.
.B vislock
can also allow shutdown and reboot operations directly, without unlocking.
The behaviour of
.B vislock
is completely controlled by command-line arguments:  it does not use a
configuration file or environment variables.
.P
.B vislock
can be configured (at compile time) to use either logind or
the utmp file to identify locally logged-in users, and will accept any
of their passwords to unlock the computer.  That list can be augmented
on the command line (with -u), allowing the locker to be invoked even
when there is no local user.  (The root user is not special in this
regard.  root must be logged in, or mentioned on the command line, to
be able to unlock the screen.)
.P
Since
.B vislock
can display dynamic values on the lock screen (e.g., time of day, and
battery capacity), it will respond to SIGUSR1 by refreshing its
screen, which is useful after the system resumes from suspend.  (The
screen will update every 30 seconds, regardless.)
.P
Obviously,
.B vislock
must interact with PAM.  If the PAM configuration for "unknown" services
(in /etc/pam.d/other) is overly restrictive, you may need to provide a
.BR vislock -specific
configuration in /etc/pam.d/vislock.  A sample file (vislock.pam) which
may help is provided with the sources.
.P
.B vislock
is an extension of the
.B physlock
screen locker, and is mostly backward compatible.  It was renamed to avoid
confusion with the original project, and with its distribution packages.  The
name "vislock" was mainly chosen because it rhymes with the original.
.B physlock
itself was written as an alternative to 
.BR vlock .
.SH OPTIONS

.SS Options that affect appearance of the lock screen:
.TP
.BI "\-p " MSG
Display
.I MSG
when
.B vislock
starts.  MSG can be multiline, with embedded newlines.  A newline will
be appended if MSG doesn't end with one.

.TP
.B \-t
Display date and time on the lockscreen.

.TP
.B \-b
Display battery capacity on lockscreen, using
the value found in /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/capacity.  This option
will be ignored (with a warning) if that path is inaccessible.

.TP
.B \-n
Display the names of users who can unlock on the lockscreen.

.TP
.B \-c
Allow "shutdown" and "reboot" commands (literally), in addition to
the user password.  No authentication is performed.

.TP
.BI "\-f " FONTFILE
Set the console font using
.IR FONTFILE .
.I FONTFILE
must be a full pathname, and will be loaded by /usr/bin/setfont.

.TP
.BI "\-o " MINUTES
Set the lock screen "off" timeout (i.e. going blank).  Default is 0,
which suppresses blanking.

.TP
.B \-m
Mute kernel messages on console while
.B vislock is running.

.SS Configuration options:

.TP
.BI "\-u " USER
Allow 
.I USER
to unlock the screen.  If
.B -u
is given multiple times, any of the respective passwords will cause an
unlock.  For backward compatibility with
.BR physlock,
add "-u root".

.TP
.B \-s
Disable SysRq mechanism while
.B vislock
is running.

.TP
.B \-d
Fork and detach
.B vislock
into the background before asking for authentication.  This option
is useful for use in suspend/hibernate scripts.

.SS Debug and troubleshooting:

.TP
.B \-l
Lock (i.e., disable) console switching, and exit.

.TP
.B \-L
Enable (unlock) console switching, and exit.  This is useful for
unlocking the screen via an ssh session, perhaps needed as a result
of a
.B vislock
crash, bug, or misconfiguration.  (The old
.B vislock
process will likely need to be killed, in addition.)

.SS Informational:
.TP
.B \-v
Print version information to standard output and exit.
.TP
.B \-h
Print brief usage information to standard error and exit.
